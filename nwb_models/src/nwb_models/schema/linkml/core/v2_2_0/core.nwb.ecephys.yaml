  ElectricalSeries:
    name: ElectricalSeries
    description: A time series of acquired voltage data from extracellular recordings.
      The data field is an int or float array storing data in volts. The first dimension
      should always represent time. The second dimension, if present, should represent
      channels.

          attribute) AND by the global conversion factor in the 'conversion' attribute
          of 'data' to get the data values in Volts, i.e, data in Volts = data * data.conversion
          * channel_conversion. This approach allows for both global and per-channel
          data conversion factors needed to support the storage of electrical recordings
          as native values generated by data acquisition systems. If this dataset
          is not present, then there is no channel-specific conversion factor, i.e.
          it is 1 for all channels.
