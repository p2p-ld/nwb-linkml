  AbstractFeatureSeries:
    name: AbstractFeatureSeries
    description: Abstract features, such as quantitative descriptions of sensory stimuli.
      The TimeSeries::data field is a 2D array, storing those features (e.g., for
      visual grating stimulus this might be orientation, spatial frequency and contrast).
      Null stimuli (eg, uniform gray) can be marked as being an independent feature
      (eg, 1.0 for gray, 0.0 for actual stimulus) or by storing NaNs for feature values,
      or through use of the TimeSeries::control fields. A set of features is considered
      to persist until the next set of features is defined. The final set of features
      stored should be the null set. This is useful when storing the raw stimulus
      is impractical.
