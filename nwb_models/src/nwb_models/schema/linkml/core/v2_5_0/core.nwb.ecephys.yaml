  ElectricalSeries:
    name: ElectricalSeries
    description: A time series of acquired voltage data from extracellular recordings.
      The data field is an int or float array storing data in volts. The first dimension
      should always represent time. The second dimension, if present, should represent
      channels.

      filtering:
        name: filtering
        description: Filtering applied to all channels of the data. For example, if
          this ElectricalSeries represents high-pass-filtered data (also known as
          AP Band), then this value could be "High-pass 4-pole Bessel filter at 500
          Hz". If this ElectricalSeries represents low-pass-filtered LFP data and
          the type of filter is unknown, then this value could be "Low-pass filter
          at 300 Hz". If a non-standard filter type is used, provide as much detail
          about the filter properties as possible.

      channel_conversion:
        name: channel_conversion
        description: Channel-specific conversion factor. Multiply the data in the
          'data' dataset by these values along the channel axis (as indicated by axis
          attribute) AND by the global conversion factor in the 'conversion' attribute
          of 'data' to get the data values in Volts, i.e, data in Volts = data * data.conversion
          * channel_conversion. This approach allows for both global and per-channel
          data conversion factors needed to support the storage of electrical recordings
          as native values generated by data acquisition systems. If this dataset
          is not present, then there is no channel-specific conversion factor, i.e.
          it is 1 for all channels.
