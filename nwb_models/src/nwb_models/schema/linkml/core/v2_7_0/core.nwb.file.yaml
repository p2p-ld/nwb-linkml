          tracking video, or even binary lick/no-lick decisions. Common software tools

          as as part of an experiment. In this case both, the stimulus and response
          will point to the same TimeSeries while the idx_start and count of the invalid

          for the stimulus or response, respectively. Note, a recording MUST contain
          at least a stimulus or a response. Typically the stimulus and response are
          PatchClampSeries. However, the use of AD/DA channels that are not associated
          to an electrode is also common in intracellular electrophysiology, in which
          case other TimeSeries may be used.
