  VectorData:
    name: VectorData
    description: An n-dimensional dataset representing a column of a DynamicTable.
      If used without an accompanying VectorIndex, first dimension is along the rows
      of the DynamicTable and each step along the first dimension is a cell of the
      larger table. VectorData can also be used to represent a ragged array if paired
      with a VectorIndex. This allows for storing arrays of varying length in a single
      cell of the DynamicTable by indexing into this VectorData. The first vector
      is at VectorData[0:VectorIndex[0]]. The second vector is at VectorData[VectorIndex[0]:VectorIndex[1]],
      and so on.

      into the first dimension of the target VectorData, and forming a map between
      the rows of a DynamicTable and the indices of the VectorData. The name of the
      VectorIndex is expected to be the name of the target VectorData object followed

  DynamicTableRegion:
    name: DynamicTableRegion
    description: DynamicTableRegion provides a link from one table to an index or
      region of another. The `table` attribute is a link to another `DynamicTable`,
      indicating which table is referenced, and the data is int(s) indicating the
      row(s) (0-indexed) of the target array. `DynamicTableRegion`s can be used to
      associate rows with repeated meta-data without data duplication. They can also
      be used to create hierarchical relationships between multiple `DynamicTable`s.
      `DynamicTableRegion` objects may be paired with a `VectorIndex` object to create
      ragged references, so a single cell of a `DynamicTable` can reference many rows
      of another `DynamicTable`.

  DynamicTable:
    name: DynamicTable
    description: A group containing multiple datasets that are aligned on the first
      dimension (Currently, this requirement if left up to APIs to check and enforce).
      These datasets represent different columns in the table. Apart from a column
      that contains unique identifiers for each row, there are no other required datasets.
      Users are free to add any number of custom VectorData objects (columns) here.
      DynamicTable also supports ragged array columns, where each element can be of
      a different size. To add a ragged array column, use a VectorIndex type to index
      the corresponding VectorData type. See documentation for VectorData and VectorIndex
      for more details. Unlike a compound data type, which is analogous to storing
      an array-of-structs, a DynamicTable can be thought of as a struct-of-arrays.
      This provides an alternative structure to choose from when optimizing storage
      for anticipated access patterns. Additionally, this type provides a way of creating
      a table without having to define a compound type up front. Although this convenience
      may be attractive, users should think carefully about how data will be accessed.
      DynamicTable is more appropriate for column-centric access, whereas a dataset
      with a compound type would be more appropriate for row-centric access. Finally,
      data size should also be taken into account. For small tables, performance loss
      may be an acceptable trade-off for the flexibility of a DynamicTable.
