  VectorData:
    name: VectorData
    description: An n-dimensional dataset representing a column of a DynamicTable.
      If used without an accompanying VectorIndex, first dimension is along the rows
      of the DynamicTable and each step along the first dimension is a cell of the
      larger table. VectorData can also be used to represent a ragged array if paired
      with a VectorIndex. This allows for storing arrays of varying length in a single
      cell of the DynamicTable by indexing into this VectorData. The first vector
      is at VectorData[0:VectorIndex(0)+1]. The second vector is at VectorData[VectorIndex(0)+1:VectorIndex(1)+1],
      and so on.

  DynamicTableRegion:
    name: DynamicTableRegion
    description: DynamicTableRegion provides a link from one table to an index or
      region of another. The `table` attribute is a link to another `DynamicTable`,
      indicating which table is referenced, and the data is int(s) indicating the
      row(s) (0-indexed) of the target array. `DynamicTableRegion`s can be used to
      associate rows with repeated meta-data without data duplication. They can also
      be used to create hierarchical relationships between multiple `DynamicTable`s.
      `DynamicTableRegion` objects may be paired with a `VectorIndex` object to create
      ragged references, so a single cell of a `DynamicTable` can reference many rows
      of another `DynamicTable`.

  DynamicTable:
    name: DynamicTable
    description: A group containing multiple datasets that are aligned on the first
      dimension (Currently, this requirement if left up to APIs to check and enforce).
      Apart from a column that contains unique identifiers for each row there are
      no other required datasets. Users are free to add any number of VectorData objects
      here. Table functionality is already supported through compound types, which
      is analogous to storing an array-of-structs. DynamicTable can be thought of
      as a struct-of-arrays. This provides an alternative structure to choose from
      when optimizing storage for anticipated access patterns. Additionally, this
      type provides a way of creating a table without having to define a compound
      type up front. Although this convenience may be attractive, users should think
      carefully about how data will be accessed. DynamicTable is more appropriate
      for column-centric access, whereas a dataset with a compound type would be more
      appropriate for row-centric access. Finally, data size should also be taken
      into account. For small tables, performance loss may be an acceptable trade-off
      for the flexibility of a DynamicTable. For example, DynamicTable was originally
      developed for storing trial data and spike unit metadata. Both of these use
      cases are expected to produce relatively small tables, so the spatial locality
      of multiple datasets present in a DynamicTable is not expected to have a significant
      performance impact. Additionally, requirements of trial and unit metadata tables
      are sufficiently diverse that performance implications can be overlooked in
      favor of usability.
