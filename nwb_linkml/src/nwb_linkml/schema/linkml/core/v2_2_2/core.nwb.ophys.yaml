      with storage for multiple imaging planes (masks) supported. Each ROI is stored
      in its own subgroup, with the ROI group containing both a 2D mask and a list
      of pixels that make up this mask. Segments can also be used for masking neuropil.
      If segmentation is allowed to change with time, a new imaging plane (or module)
      is required and ROI names should remain consistent between them.
