      stored in the NWB file, or empty, if the data is stored in an external image
      stack. [frame][x][y] or [frame][x][y][z].

        description: Each external image may contain one or more consecutive frames
          of the full ImageSeries. This attribute serves as an index to indicate which
          frames each file contains, to faciliate random access. The 'starting_frame'
          attribute, hence, contains a list of frame numbers within the full ImageSeries
          of the first frame of each file listed in the parent 'external_file' dataset.
          Zero-based indexing is used (hence, the first element will always be zero).
          For example, if the 'external_file' dataset has three paths to files and
          the first file has 5 frames, the second file has 10 frames, and the third
          file has 20 frames, then this attribute will have values [0, 5, 15]. If
          there is a single external file that holds all of the frames of the ImageSeries
          (and so there is a single element in the 'external_file' dataset), then
          this attribute should have value [0].

      the image covers, or how what is the area of the target being imaged). If the

      display of individual images, or of movie segments (as a movie is simply a series
      of images). The data field stores the index of the frame in the referenced ImageSeries,
      and the timestamps array indicates when that image was displayed.
