          attribute, hence, contains a list of frame numbers within the full ImageSeries
          of the first frame of each file listed in the parent 'external_file' dataset.
          Zero-based indexing is used (hence, the first element will always be zero).
          For example, if the 'external_file' dataset has three paths to files and
          the first file has 5 frames, the second file has 10 frames, and the third
          file has 20 frames, then this attribute will have values [0, 5, 15]. If
          there is a single external file that holds all of the frames of the ImageSeries
          (and so there is a single element in the 'external_file' dataset), then
          this attribute should have value [0].

      of images). The data field stores the index of the frame in the referenced ImageSeries,
      and the timestamps array indicates when that image was displayed.
