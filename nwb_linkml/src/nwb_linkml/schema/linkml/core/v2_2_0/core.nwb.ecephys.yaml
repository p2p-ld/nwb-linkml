  ElectricalSeries:

    description: A time series of acquired voltage data from extracellular recordings.

      should always represent time. The second dimension, if present, should represent
      channels.

          as native values generated by data acquisition systems. If this dataset

      should be informative. The source of the filtered data, whether this is from
      analysis of another time series or as acquired by hardware, should be noted
      in each's TimeSeries::description field. There is no assumed 1::1 correspondence
      between filtered ephys signals and electrodes, as a single signal can apply
      to many nearby electrodes, and one electrode may have different filtered (e.g.,
      theta and/or gamma) signals represented. Filter properties should be noted in
      the ElectricalSeries.
