  AbstractFeatureSeries:
    name: AbstractFeatureSeries
    description: Abstract features, such as quantitative descriptions of sensory stimuli.
      The TimeSeries::data field is a 2D array, storing those features (e.g., for
      visual grating stimulus this might be orientation, spatial frequency and contrast).
      Null stimuli (eg, uniform gray) can be marked as being an independent feature
      (eg, 1.0 for gray, 0.0 for actual stimulus) or by storing NaNs for feature values,
      or through use of the TimeSeries::control fields. A set of features is considered
      to persist until the next set of features is defined. The final set of features
      stored should be the null set. This is useful when storing the raw stimulus
      is impractical.

        name: waveforms
        description: Individual waveforms for each spike on each electrode. This is
          a doubly indexed column. The 'waveforms_index' column indexes which waveforms
          in this column belong to the same spike event for a given unit, where each
          waveform was recorded from a different electrode. The 'waveforms_index_index'
          column indexes the 'waveforms_index' column to indicate which spike events
          belong to a given unit. For example, if the 'waveforms_index_index' column
          has values [2, 5, 6], then the first 2 elements of the 'waveforms_index'
          column correspond to the 2 spike events of the first unit, the next 3 elements
          of the 'waveforms_index' column correspond to the 3 spike events of the
          second unit, and the next 1 element of the 'waveforms_index' column corresponds
          to the 1 spike event of the third unit. If the 'waveforms_index' column
          has values [3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13], then the first 3 elements of the 'waveforms'
          column contain the 3 spike waveforms that were recorded from 3 different
          electrodes for the first spike time of the first unit. See https://nwb-schema.readthedocs.io/en/stable/format_description.html#doubly-ragged-arrays
          for a graphical representation of this example. When there is only one electrode
          for each unit (i.e., each spike time is associated with a single waveform),
          then the 'waveforms_index' column will have values 1, 2, ..., N, where N
          is the number of spike events. The number of electrodes for each spike event
          should be the same within a given unit. The 'electrodes' column should be
          used to indicate which electrodes are associated with each unit, and the
          order of the waveforms within a given unit x spike event should be in the
          same order as the electrodes referenced in the 'electrodes' column of this
          table. The number of samples for each waveform must be the same.
