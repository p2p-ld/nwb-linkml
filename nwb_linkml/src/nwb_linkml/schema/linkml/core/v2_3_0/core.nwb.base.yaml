          other units that require a conversion to be interpretable, multiply the

          the data acquisition system stores values in this object as signed 16-bit
          integers (int16 range -32,768 to 32,767) that correspond to a 5V range (-2.5V
          to 2.5V), and the data acquisition system gain is 8000X, then the 'conversion'
          multiplier to get from raw data acquisition values to recorded volts is

          because samples are recorded from a continuous process. An array of lick
          times would be "instantaneous", because the data represents distinct moments
          in time. Times of image presentations would be "step" because the picture
          remains the same until the next timepoint. This field is optional, but is
          useful in providing information about the underlying data. It may inform
          the way this data is interpreted, the way it is visualized, and what analysis
          methods are applicable.
