  AbstractFeatureSeries:
    name: AbstractFeatureSeries
    description: Abstract features, such as quantitative descriptions of sensory stimuli.
      The TimeSeries::data field is a 2D array, storing those features (e.g., for
      visual grating stimulus this might be orientation, spatial frequency and contrast).
      Null stimuli (eg, uniform gray) can be marked as being an independent feature
      (eg, 1.0 for gray, 0.0 for actual stimulus) or by storing NaNs for feature values,
      or through use of the TimeSeries::control fields. A set of features is considered
      to persist until the next set of features is defined. The final set of features
      stored should be the null set. This is useful when storing the raw stimulus
      is impractical.

          waveform was recorded from a different electrode. The 'waveforms_index_index'
          column indexes the 'waveforms_index' column to indicate which spike events
          belong to a given unit. For example, if the 'waveforms_index_index' column
          has values [2, 5, 6], then the first 2 elements of the 'waveforms_index'
          column correspond to the 2 spike events of the first unit, the next 3 elements

          second unit, and the next 1 element of the 'waveforms_index' column corresponds
          to the 1 spike event of the third unit. If the 'waveforms_index' column
          has values [3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13], then the first 3 elements of the 'waveforms'
          column contain the 3 spike waveforms that were recorded from 3 different

          is the number of spike events. The number of electrodes for each spike event
          should be the same within a given unit. The 'electrodes' column should be

          same order as the electrodes referenced in the 'electrodes' column of this
