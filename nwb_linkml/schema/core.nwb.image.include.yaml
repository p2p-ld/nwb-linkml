  ImageSeries__external_file:
    name: ImageSeries__external_file
    description: Paths to one or more external file(s). The field is only present
      if format='external'. This is only relevant if the image series is stored in
      the file system as one or more image file(s). This field should NOT be used
      if the image is stored in another NWB file and that file is linked to this file.
    attributes:
      starting_frame:
        name: starting_frame
        description: Each external image may contain one or more consecutive frames
          of the full ImageSeries. This attribute serves as an index to indicate which
          frames each file contains, to facilitate random access. The 'starting_frame'
          attribute, hence, contains a list of frame numbers within the full ImageSeries
          of the first frame of each file listed in the parent 'external_file' dataset.
          Zero-based indexing is used (hence, the first element will always be zero).
          For example, if the 'external_file' dataset has three paths to files and
          the first file has 5 frames, the second file has 10 frames, and the third
          file has 20 frames, then this attribute will have values [0, 5, 15]. If
          there is a single external file that holds all of the frames of the ImageSeries
          (and so there is a single element in the 'external_file' dataset), then
          this attribute should have value [0].
