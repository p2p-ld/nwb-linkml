      recording consisting typically of a stimulus and a corresponding response. In
      some cases, however, only a stimulus or a response is recorded as part of an
      experiment. In this case, both the stimulus and response will point to the same
      TimeSeries while the idx_start and count of the invalid column will be set to
      -1, thus, indicating that no values have been recorded for the stimulus or response,
      respectively. Note, a recording MUST contain at least a stimulus or a response.
      Typically the stimulus and response are PatchClampSeries. However, the use of
      AD/DA channels that are not associated to an electrode is also common in intracellular
      electrophysiology, in which case other TimeSeries may be used.
