      -1, thus, indicating that no values have been recorded for the stimulus or response,
      respectively. Note, a recording MUST contain at least a stimulus or a response.
      Typically the stimulus and response are PatchClampSeries. However, the use of
      AD/DA channels that are not associated to an electrode is also common in intracellular
      electrophysiology, in which case other TimeSeries may be used.
