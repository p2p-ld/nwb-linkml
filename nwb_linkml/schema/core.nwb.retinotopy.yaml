  ImagingRetinotopy:
    name: ImagingRetinotopy
    description: 'Intrinsic signal optical imaging or widefield imaging for measuring
      retinotopy. Stores orthogonal maps (e.g., altitude/azimuth; radius/theta) of
      responses to specific stimuli and a combined polarity map from which to identify
      visual areas. This group does not store the raw responses imaged during retinotopic
      mapping or the stimuli presented, but rather the resulting phase and power maps
      after applying a Fourier transform on the averaged responses. Note: for data
      consistency, all images and arrays are stored in the format [row][column] and
      [row, col], which equates to [y][x]. Field of view and dimension arrays may
      appear backward (i.e., y before x).'
