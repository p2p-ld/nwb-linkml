          (a) data stored in an unsigned type that requires a shift after scaling
          to re-center the data, and (b) specialized recording devices that naturally
          cause a scalar offset with respect to the true units.

          because samples are recorded from a continuous process. An array of lick
          times would be "instantaneous", because the data represents distinct moments
          in time. Times of image presentations would be "step" because the picture
          remains the same until the next timepoint. This field is optional, but is
          useful in providing information about the underlying data. It may inform
          the way this data is interpreted, the way it is visualized, and what analysis
          methods are applicable.
