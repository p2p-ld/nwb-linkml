  Units__waveforms:
    name: Units__waveforms
    description: Individual waveforms for each spike on each electrode. This is a
      doubly indexed column. The 'waveforms_index' column indexes which waveforms
      in this column belong to the same spike event for a given unit, where each waveform
      was recorded from a different electrode. The 'waveforms_index_index' column
      indexes the 'waveforms_index' column to indicate which spike events belong to
      a given unit. For example, if the 'waveforms_index_index' column has values
      [2, 5, 6], then the first 2 elements of the 'waveforms_index' column correspond
      to the 2 spike events of the first unit, the next 3 elements of the 'waveforms_index'
      column correspond to the 3 spike events of the second unit, and the next 1 element
      of the 'waveforms_index' column corresponds to the 1 spike event of the third
      unit. If the 'waveforms_index' column has values [3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13], then
      the first 3 elements of the 'waveforms' column contain the 3 spike waveforms
      that were recorded from 3 different electrodes for the first spike time of the
      first unit. See https://nwb-schema.readthedocs.io/en/stable/format_description.html#doubly-ragged-arrays
      for a graphical representation of this example. When there is only one electrode
      for each unit (i.e., each spike time is associated with a single waveform),
      then the 'waveforms_index' column will have values 1, 2, ..., N, where N is
      the number of spike events. The number of electrodes for each spike event should
      be the same within a given unit. The 'electrodes' column should be used to indicate
      which electrodes are associated with each unit, and the order of the waveforms
      within a given unit x spike event should be in the same order as the electrodes
      referenced in the 'electrodes' column of this table. The number of samples for
      each waveform must be the same.
