          For example, this can be a text description of the anatomical location and

          vectors needed to transform or rotate the grid to a common anatomical axis

          grid_spacing. If origin_coords and grid_spacing are not present, then this
          field is not required. For example, if the microscope takes 10 x 10 x 2
          images, where the first value of the data matrix (index (0, 0, 0)) corresponds
          to (-1.2, -0.6, -2) mm relative to bregma, the spacing between pixels is
          0.2 mm in x, 0.2 mm in y and 0.5 mm in z, and larger numbers in x means
          more anterior, larger numbers in y means more rightward, and larger numbers
          in z means more ventral, then enter the following -- origin_coords = (-1.2,
          -0.6, -2) grid_spacing = (0.2, 0.2, 0.5) reference_frame = "Origin coordinates
          are relative to bregma. First dimension corresponds to anterior-posterior
          axis (larger index = more anterior). Second dimension corresponds to medial-lateral
          axis (larger index = more rightward). Third dimension corresponds to dorsal-ventral
