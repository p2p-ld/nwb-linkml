          in the file. Acquired data includes tracking and experimental data streams
          (i.e., everything measured from the system). If bulky data is stored in
          the /acquisition group, the data can exist in a separate NWB file that is
          linked to by the file being used for processing and analysis.

          and appropriately documented. The file can store lab-specific and custom
          data analysis without restriction on its form or schema, reducing data formatting
          restrictions on end users. Such data should be placed in the analysis group.

        description: The home for ProcessingModules. These modules perform intermediate

          Examples include spike clustering, extracting position from tracking data,
          stitching together image slices. ProcessingModules can be large and express
          many data sets from relatively complex analysis (e.g., spike detection and
          clustering) or small, representing extraction of position information from
          tracking video, or even binary lick/no-lick decisions. Common software tools
          (e.g., klustakwik, MClust) are expected to read/write data here.  'Processing'
          refers to intermediate analysis of the acquired data to make it more amenable
          to scientific analysis.

          used as a stimulus). This group should be made read-only after experiment
          complete and timestamps are corrected to common timebase. Stores both presented
          stimuli and stimulus templates, the latter in case the same stimulus is
          presented multiple times, or is pulled from an external stimulus library.
          Stimuli are here defined as any signal that is pushed into the system as
          part of the experiment (eg, sound, video, voltage, etc). Many different
          experiments can use the same stimuli, and stimuli can be re-used during
          an experiment. The stimulus group is organized so that one version of template
          stimuli can be stored and these be used multiple times. These templates
          can exist in the present file or can be linked to a remote library file.

      general:
        name: general
        description: Experimental metadata, including protocol, notes and description
          of hardware device(s).  The metadata stored in this section should be used
          to describe the experiment. Metadata necessary for interpreting the data
          is stored with the data. General experimental metadata, including animal
          strain, experimental protocols, experimenter, devices, etc, are stored under
          'general'. Core metadata (e.g., that required to interpret data fields)
          is stored with the data itself, and implicitly defined by the file specification
          (e.g., time is in seconds). The strategy used here for storing non-core
          metadata is to use free-form text fields, such as would appear in sentences
          or paragraphs from a Methods section. Metadata fields are text to enable
          them to be more general, for example to represent ranges instead of numerical
          values. Machine-readable metadata is stored as attributes to these free-form
          datasets. All entries in the below table are to be included when data is
          present. Unused groups (e.g., intracellular_ephys in an optophysiology experiment)
          should not be created unless there is data to store within them.
