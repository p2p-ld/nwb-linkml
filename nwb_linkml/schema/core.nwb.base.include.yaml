  TimeSeries__data:
    name: TimeSeries__data
    description: Data values. Data can be in 1-D, 2-D, 3-D, or 4-D. The first dimension
      should always represent time. This can also be used to store binary data (e.g.,
      image frames). This can also be a link to data stored in an external file.
    attributes:
      conversion:
        name: conversion
        description: Scalar to multiply each element in data to convert it to the
          specified 'unit'. If the data are stored in acquisition system units or
          other units that require a conversion to be interpretable, multiply the
          data by 'conversion' to convert the data to the specified 'unit'. e.g. if
          the data acquisition system stores values in this object as signed 16-bit
          integers (int16 range -32,768 to 32,767) that correspond to a 5V range (-2.5V
          to 2.5V), and the data acquisition system gain is 8000X, then the 'conversion'
          multiplier to get from raw data acquisition values to recorded volts is
          2.5/32768/8000 = 9.5367e-9.
        range: float32
      offset:
        name: offset
        description: Scalar to add to the data after scaling by 'conversion' to finalize
          its coercion to the specified 'unit'. Two common examples of this include
          (a) data stored in an unsigned type that requires a shift after scaling
          to re-center the data, and (b) specialized recording devices that naturally
          cause a scalar offset with respect to the true units.
        range: float32
      resolution:
        name: resolution
        description: Smallest meaningful difference between values in data, stored
          in the specified by unit, e.g., the change in value of the least significant
          bit, or a larger number if signal noise is known to be present. If unknown,
          use -1.0.
        range: float32
      unit:
        name: unit
        description: Base unit of measurement for working with the data. Actual stored
          values are not necessarily stored in these units. To access the data in
          these units, multiply 'data' by 'conversion' and add 'offset'.
        range: text
      continuity:
        name: continuity
        description: Optionally describe the continuity of the data. Can be "continuous",
          "instantaneous", or "step". For example, a voltage trace would be "continuous",
          because samples are recorded from a continuous process. An array of lick
          times would be "instantaneous", because the data represents distinct moments
          in time. Times of image presentations would be "step" because the picture
          remains the same until the next timepoint. This field is optional, but is
          useful in providing information about the underlying data. It may inform
          the way this data is interpreted, the way it is visualized, and what analysis
          methods are applicable.

  TimeSeries__starting_time:
    name: TimeSeries__starting_time
    description: Timestamp of the first sample in seconds. When timestamps are uniformly
      spaced, the timestamp of the first sample can be specified and all subsequent
      ones calculated from the sampling rate attribute.
    attributes:

  TimeSeries__control:

    description: Numerical labels that apply to each time point in data for the purpose

      array should be the same size as the first dimension of data.
    attributes:

        description: Description of each control value. Must be present if control
          is present. If present, control_description[0] should describe time points

  TimeSeries__sync:
    name: TimeSeries__sync
    description: Lab-specific time and sync information as provided directly from
      hardware devices and that is necessary for aligning all acquired time information
      to a common timebase. The timestamp array stores time in the common timebase.
      This group will usually only be populated in TimeSeries that are stored external
      to the NWB file, in files storing raw data. Once timestamp data is calculated,
      the contents of 'sync' are mostly for archival purposes.
  Images__order_of_images:
    name: Images__order_of_images
    description: Ordered dataset of references to Image objects stored in the parent
      group. Each Image object in the Images group should be stored once and only
      once, so the dataset should have the same length as the number of images.
