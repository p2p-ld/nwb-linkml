        description: Each external image may contain one or more consecutive frames

          frames each file contains, to facilitate random access. The 'starting_frame'
          attribute, hence, contains a list of frame numbers within the full ImageSeries
          of the first frame of each file listed in the parent 'external_file' dataset.
          Zero-based indexing is used (hence, the first element will always be zero).
          For example, if the 'external_file' dataset has three paths to files and
          the first file has 5 frames, the second file has 10 frames, and the third
          file has 20 frames, then this attribute will have values [0, 5, 15]. If
          there is a single external file that holds all of the frames of the ImageSeries
          (and so there is a single element in the 'external_file' dataset), then
          this attribute should have value [0].

    description: An alpha mask that is applied to a presented visual stimulus. The

      the image covers, or how what is the area of the target being imaged). If the

      be for the display of individual images, or of movie segments (as a movie is
      simply a series of images). The data field stores the index of the frame in
      the referenced Images object, and the timestamps array indicates when that image
      was displayed.
