  ElectricalSeries:
    name: ElectricalSeries
    description: A time series of acquired voltage data from extracellular recordings.
      The data field is an int or float array storing data in volts. The first dimension
      should always represent time. The second dimension, if present, should represent
      channels.

        description: Filtering applied to all channels of the data. For example, if
          this ElectricalSeries represents high-pass-filtered data (also known as
          AP Band), then this value could be "High-pass 4-pole Bessel filter at 500
          Hz". If this ElectricalSeries represents low-pass-filtered LFP data and
          the type of filter is unknown, then this value could be "Low-pass filter
          at 300 Hz". If a non-standard filter type is used, provide as much detail
          about the filter properties as possible.
