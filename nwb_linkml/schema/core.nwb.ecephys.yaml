  ElectricalSeries:
    name: ElectricalSeries
    description: A time series of acquired voltage data from extracellular recordings.
      The data field is an int or float array storing data in volts. The first dimension
      should always represent time. The second dimension, if present, should represent
      channels.
    is_a: TimeSeries
    attributes:
      filtering:
        name: filtering
        description: Filtering applied to all channels of the data. For example, if
          this ElectricalSeries represents high-pass-filtered data (also known as
          AP Band), then this value could be "High-pass 4-pole Bessel filter at 500
          Hz". If this ElectricalSeries represents low-pass-filtered LFP data and
          the type of filter is unknown, then this value could be "Low-pass filter
          at 300 Hz". If a non-standard filter type is used, provide as much detail
          about the filter properties as possible.

      channel_conversion:
        name: channel_conversion
        description: Channel-specific conversion factor. Multiply the data in the
          'data' dataset by these values along the channel axis (as indicated by axis
          attribute) AND by the global conversion factor in the 'conversion' attribute
          of 'data' to get the data values in Volts, i.e, data in Volts = data * data.conversion
          * channel_conversion. This approach allows for both global and per-channel
          data conversion factors needed to support the storage of electrical recordings
          as native values generated by data acquisition systems. If this dataset
          is not present, then there is no channel-specific conversion factor, i.e.
          it is 1 for all channels.

      All SpikeEventSeries should reside in a module (under EventWaveform interface)
      even if the spikes were reported and stored by hardware. All events span the
      same recording channels and store snapshots of equal duration. TimeSeries::data

  FilteredEphys:
    name: FilteredEphys
    description: Electrophysiology data from one or more channels that has been subjected
      to filtering. Examples of filtered data include Theta and Gamma (LFP has its
      own interface). FilteredEphys modules publish an ElectricalSeries for each filtered
      channel or set of channels. The name of each ElectricalSeries is arbitrary but
      should be informative. The source of the filtered data, whether this is from
      analysis of another time series or as acquired by hardware, should be noted
      in each's TimeSeries::description field. There is no assumed 1::1 correspondence
      between filtered ephys signals and electrodes, as a single signal can apply
      to many nearby electrodes, and one electrode may have different filtered (e.g.,
      theta and/or gamma) signals represented. Filter properties should be noted in
      the ElectricalSeries 'filtering' attribute.
