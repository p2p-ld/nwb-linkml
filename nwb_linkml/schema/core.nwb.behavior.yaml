  SpatialSeries:
    name: SpatialSeries
    description: 'Direction, e.g., of gaze or travel, or position. The TimeSeries::data
      field is a 2D array storing position or direction relative to some reference
      frame. Array structure: [num measurements] [num dimensions]. Each SpatialSeries
      has a text dataset reference_frame that indicates the zero-position, or the
      zero-axes for direction. For example, if representing gaze direction, ''straight-ahead''
      might be a specific pixel on the monitor, or some other point in space. For
      position data, the 0,0 point might be the top-left corner of an enclosure, as
      viewed from the tracking camera. The unit of data will indicate how to interpret
      SpatialSeries values.'

  BehavioralEpochs:
    name: BehavioralEpochs
    description: TimeSeries for storing behavioral epochs.  The objective of this
      and the other two Behavioral interfaces (e.g. BehavioralEvents and BehavioralTimeSeries)
      is to provide generic hooks for software tools/scripts. This allows a tool/script
      to take the output one specific interface (e.g., UnitTimes) and plot that data
      relative to another data modality (e.g., behavioral events) without having to
      define all possible modalities in advance. Declaring one of these interfaces
      means that one or more TimeSeries of the specified type is published. These
      TimeSeries should reside in a group having the same name as the interface. For
      example, if a BehavioralTimeSeries interface is declared, the module will have
      one or more TimeSeries defined in the module sub-group 'BehavioralTimeSeries'.
      BehavioralEpochs should use IntervalSeries. BehavioralEvents is used for irregular
      events. BehavioralTimeSeries is for continuous data.
