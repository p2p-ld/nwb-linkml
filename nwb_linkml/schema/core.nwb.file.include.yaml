    description: Data pushed into the system (eg, video stimulus, sound, voltage,
      etc) and secondary representations of that data (eg, measurements of something
      used as a stimulus). This group should be made read-only after experiment complete
      and timestamps are corrected to common timebase. Stores both presented stimuli
      and stimulus templates, the latter in case the same stimulus is presented multiple
      times, or is pulled from an external stimulus library. Stimuli are here defined
      as any signal that is pushed into the system as part of the experiment (eg,
      sound, video, voltage, etc). Many different experiments can use the same stimuli,
      and stimuli can be re-used during an experiment. The stimulus group is organized
      so that one version of template stimuli can be stored and these be used multiple
      times. These templates can exist in the present file or can be linked to a remote
      library file.

  NWBFile__general:
    name: NWBFile__general
    description: Experimental metadata, including protocol, notes and description
      of hardware device(s).  The metadata stored in this section should be used to
      describe the experiment. Metadata necessary for interpreting the data is stored
      with the data. General experimental metadata, including animal strain, experimental
      protocols, experimenter, devices, etc, are stored under 'general'. Core metadata
      (e.g., that required to interpret data fields) is stored with the data itself,
      and implicitly defined by the file specification (e.g., time is in seconds).
      The strategy used here for storing non-core metadata is to use free-form text
      fields, such as would appear in sentences or paragraphs from a Methods section.
      Metadata fields are text to enable them to be more general, for example to represent
      ranges instead of numerical values. Machine-readable metadata is stored as attributes
      to these free-form datasets. All entries in the below table are to be included
      when data is present. Unused groups (e.g., intracellular_ephys in an optophysiology
      experiment) should not be created unless there is data to store within them.

          PatchClampSeries. However, the use of AD/DA channels that are not associated
          to an electrode is also common in intracellular electrophysiology, in which
